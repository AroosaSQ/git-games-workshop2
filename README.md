# git-games-workshop2
A collection of git based challenges for GrizzlyHacks' second git workshop

Make sure to fetch *all* branches using `git fetch --all`!

### Challenge 1
**Merge a branch with master**

Simply merge the branch "mergeme" with master.

### Challenge 2
**Find the commit that broke master**

Inside the master branch, you'll find a script called *broken.sh*. One of the commits broke this script. You'll need to find the commit ID!

### Challenge 3
**Rebase a branch with master**

There is a branch called "rebaseme". Add it to master without using `git merge`.
